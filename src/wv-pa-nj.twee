[img[jersey.jpg]]
 After hearing the legends of a terrifying creature that inhabits the Pine Barrens, you 
 \decide to travel to Southern New Jersey. Wandering around the nearby towns, you find a local 
 \willing to tell you the tale of the Jersey Devil.
 
 <<linkreplace "Talk to Local">> \
  <<linkappend "__Local__: It all starts back in 1735. Mother Leeds, as she is now known, cursed her child when she found out she was pregnant for the 14th time.">>
   <<linkappend "__You__: She cursed her own child?">>
    <<linkappend "__Local__: Yes, she cried out that it would be the devil. On a stormy night, she went into labor and that became true. Although the child was born normal, she soon transformed into a creature with hooves, a goatâ€™s head, bat wings and a forked tail.">>
     <<linkappend "__You__: And that is what became the Jersey Devil.">>
      __Local__: Indeed. It then went on to be blamed for livestock killings, reported along with tracks and screams.Legend says it feeds on animals out in the Pine Barrens to this day.
