!Texas - Chupacabra
 Originating in South America and Puerto Rico, the Chupacabra has been spotted in rural areas 
\of Texas, where you have made your next stop. While visiting the nearby farmers, you find someone 
\who tells you their story.

   <<linkappend "__Farmer__: These reptile-like creatures with fangs and claws are known to feast on livestock, mainly goast, by draining their blood.">>
    <<linkappend "__You__: Like a vampire?">>
     __Farmer__: Correct. They were originally called el vampiro de Moca, or the vampire of Moca, after the small town they were originally found in. They were then called chupacabras which translates to‘goat-sucker’.
